The reading passage and the lecture are talking about whether working a four-day week should be taken. The reading holds that a four-day workweek will benefit not only the companies and the employees. While, the professor claims that the arguments used to support the reading are not convincing.

To begin with, the reading passage holds that the shorten woekweek will increase company profits. However, the listening argues that hiring more staff results in the more healthy insurance costs and the company has to provide more space to hold the increasing number of employees. In fact, the company will not obtain profits from this change.

Moreover, the article says that this policy will reduce unemployment rates. But the professor argues that the company can ask these four-day workweek to work overtime, which absolutely does harm to the emplyees.

Finally, the reading passage said that the option will be better for individual employees. However, the professor argues that the option will affect the employees' job ability. Even worse, when the economy goes downtown, the four-day workweek emplyees will be the first ones lose their job.
