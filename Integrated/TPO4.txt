The reading passage and the listening are talking contradictorily about whether the dinosaurs are endotherms or not. The reading holds that there are several reasons to prove that the dinosaurs are endotherms. While the professor argues that these arguments the reading claims are not convincing.

Firstly, the reading says that dinosaur fossils have been discovered in polar regions can prove the dinosaurs are endotherms. However, the listening refutes that at that time the climates in the polar regions are warmer than now. And the dinosaurs can migrate to these places, so the fossils cannot prove that the dinosaurs are endotherms.

Secondly, the article claims that the legs of dinosaurs are underneath the body can suggest that dinosaurs are endotherms. On the contrary, the lecture mentions another explannation that the leg position can support the large size of the dinosaurs.

Thirdly, the author says that the bones of dinosaurs are dense with Haversian canals shows that dinosaurs are endotherms. Nevertheless, the lecture mentions the dinosaur bones also have growth rings which shows that the dinosaurs do not always grow rapidly especially when the environment becomes cool.

*******************************************************

The author and the professor hold different views about whether dinosaurs are endotherms or not. According to the passage, dinosaurs were capable of keeping their body temperatures stable; however, the professor denies all the arguments presented in the reading.

The passage indicates that since scientists discovered dinosaur fossils in polar regions, they must have the capacity to keep themselves warm in cold environment; yet the professor points out that the polar regions were much warmer than today, so dinosaurs could live there when the climate was suitable and they might hibernate when the weather was cold too. That means the presence of fossils is not necessarily the proof of dinosaurs’ ability to keep body temperature constant.

The author points out that dinosaurs’ legs are beneath their bodies and so are modern endotherms’, so dinosaurs are very likely to be endotherms; on the other hand, the professor claims that dinosaurs’ legs were underneath because this could allow them to grow bigger. Growing bigger could a great advantage for dinosaurs, so the position of legs does not necessarily mean that they could run or they were endotherms.

The passage suggests that the bone structure of dinosaurs shows that they were endotherms, because their bones contain Haversian canals, which is an important feature of endotherms; however, the professor says that although there are Haversian canals, dinosaurs’ bones have growth rings. Growth rings prove that dinosaurs did not constantly grow fast. This indicates that they were not endotherms which can grow rapidly no matter how the climate changes.
