The reading passage and the listening have contradictory opinions about whether selling fossils is bad for scientists and the public or not. The lecture holds that fossils are sold to private ownerships is a terrible development. While, the listening claims that the arguments used to support the reading are not convincing.

To begin with, the reading says that fossils could be denoted to museums where the public can see them. So lack of these fossils the public suffers a lot. However, the pofessor mentions that thanks to the collector, who make the fossil the great exposure, then the public can have the chance to see so many fossils in the museums.

Moreover, the lecture argues that scientists are likely to lose access to research the important fossils which may show some crucial discoveries. On the contrary, the professor points out that before selling these fossils, the scientists have already investigated them, because only the scientists have the ability to identify these fossils. Therefore, the scientists will not miss any important information.

Finally, the reading passage mentions that commercial fossil collectors will destroy the fossils because they lack of the corresponding knowledge. Nevertheless, the pofessor contends that if the collectors didn't exist, these fossils would still be buried underneath, because the scientist and the university will not have so much money to find these fossils. Thus, though the collectors may destroy some valuable information, they still made their necessary effort to find these fossils.

Model


The passage and the lecture have different views about the influence of fossil trade. The author believes it leads to many negative consequences, yet the professor believes that the benefits it brings outweigh the negative consequences.

According to the passage, the public will have fewer chances to see fossils, for many of them become collections for private collectors; however, the professor argues that as more fossils become available due to the trade, even low-level institutions like public schools and libraries can purchase fossils and show them to the public, so the public will actually gain more exposure to fossils instead of losing opportunities and interests.

The author suggests that scientists have limited budgets versus millionaire collectors, and they will be unable to get important fossils for scientific analysis so that they might miss important discoveries; yet the professor points out that, before a fossil goes to the market, it has to be tested by scientists, the only people who are qualified to do so. Since all fossils have to go through scientistsâ€™ hands first, nothing important can be missed out.

The passage indicates that since private collectors are mostly untrained, fossils and their surroundings cannot be protected and studied properly, thus, valuable evidence can be destroyed; on the contrary, the professor says that no matter how much damage collectors do to fossils and their surroundings, the fossil trade at least make more fossils discovered. Although we do not have all the information about how fossils lie in the ground and the situation of their surroundings, it is still much better than before when many fossils were completely undiscovered.
