The reading and lecture are talking about the accuracy of the events in the memoir Chevalier made. The reading holds that Chevalier distorted or invented the memior. While the professor claims that the arguments used to support the reading are not convincing, that is the memior is not modified by the Chevalier.

Firstly, the reading says that Chevalier was wealthy so he did not need to borrow money. However, the professor holds that Chevalier have the cash to shift his property, so he had to borrow some money from others to make his business continue.

Secondly, the reading passage says that it is impossible that Chevalier captured the conversations accurately. Nevertheless, the listening holds that the Chevalier could keep the notes of the whole conversation, so it can be true that Chevalier records the conversation in the memoir.

Thirdly, the article holds that Chevalier did not escape from the prison by himself. However, the speaker argued that at that time, more powerful people than Chevalier could not escape from the prison, so Chevalier escaped himself. Meanwhile, after Chevalier escaped from the prison, the prison was repaired which indicated that Chevalier indeed escaped from the prison by himself.

The passage and the lecture are mainly about the controversy of Chevalier De Seingalt’s memoir. According to the passage, the Chevalier’s memoir is inaccurate in many details; however, the professor holds a different view, claiming that the Chevalier’s descriptions in the memoir are mostly authentic.

The author suggests that the Chevalier was not as wealthy as he claimed himself to be, for he borrowed a large amount of money from someone else. Nevertheless, the professor argues that borrowing money from others does not mean that the Chevalier was poor. He probably had to wait for a few days to convert his assets into money. That’s why he got a loan, but it does not mean he was poor.

The passage indicates that the record of conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire might not be accurate, for it was written many years after the conversation happened. On the contrary, the professor claims that there is evidence that the Chevalier kept notes of the conversations and he referred to these notes very often while writing the memoir. This makes it practical for the Chevalier to recall things accurately many years later.

The author believes that the Chevalier actually escaped from prison by bribing but not by making a hole in the ceiling of his cell, for his powerful friends could have offered such a bribe. On the other hand, the professor points out that many other people with even more powerful friends did not make such a bribe to escape. Furthermore, according to an old document, the ceiling of the Chevalier’s cell needed to be repaired right after he got out. If the story was not true, the ceiling would not have to be repaired.
