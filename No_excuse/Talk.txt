Dear Professor:
  Sorry to interrupt you. Let me introduce myself.

  I am LiZikang, now a graduate student at USTC under study with Professor Liu

  I really want to apply to be your graduate student to continue my study career.

  Last year, I went to Nanjing to meet you under the guildance of Prof Liu.

  I Know that there are three courses I need to learn to pass the exam.

  So I have been improving my code capability, and already master the basic optimization methods, including deterministic and stochastic optimization.

  You told me that mastering a Programming Language, and I have been working on that.

  Maybe you know

  I notice that the application is coming.

  Don't worry about

  There will be a problem about the English score, I didn't get the opportunity to have the English test because most of the test have been cancelled due to the influence of Covid-19.

  I haven't got a satisfied English score

  I'm wondering that if you can give me the proposal if you have a appropriate project.

  and I think I'm good at modeling and coding.

  If that is ok, we can talk about that later.

  Looking forward to hearing from you.
