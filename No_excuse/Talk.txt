Dear Professor Qi:

  Good afternoon!

  Sorry to interrupt you. Maybe it will take you several minutes to read this email.

  I am LiZikang, now a graduate student of Professor Liu at USTC.

  I want to apply to be your graduate student to continue my study career.

  Last year, I went to Nanjing to meet you under the guidance of Prof. Liu.

  You told me that mastering a programming language expertly, and I have been working on that.

  Besides that, I know that there are three courses I need to learn to pass the exam.

  Therefore, I have been improving my code and modeling capability, and I have already mastered the basic optimization methods, including deterministic and stochastic optimization.

  The attachment is about my resume.

  I notice that the application is coming. So there are two problems I want to ask you.

  The first one is about the proposal, I'm wondering if you can give me a proposal if you have an appropriate topic or project.

  The second one is about English test. Last 

  There will be a problem about the English score, I didn't get the opportunity to have the English test because most of the test have been cancelled due to the influence of Covid-19.

  I haven't got a satisfied English score


  If that is ok, we can talk about that later.

  Looking forward to hearing from you.
