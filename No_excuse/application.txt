About Cinema model

# Take the course of Prof.Chen, which talked about inventory theory.

# Master python/Matlab/R and Gurobi, and practice a lot about leetcode, be capable of modeling and solve it quickly.

# Master the basic method for solving Integer Programming, contains Column generation, Cutting plane, Row generation.

# Publish a paper about the inverse UFL probelm on a Chinese Journal (Operation Research and Management.) which use the basic huristic algorithm and row generation.

# Working paper concludes that Pricing instrument for the scheduling game.
And inverse probelm of general linear programming, change it to a MIP problem.


# My undergraduate's performance is excellent, but when I was in my junior year, I realize that what I am passionate about is modeling and using programs to solve it. So I spend a lot of time to change my major.

# After studying under Prof.Liu, I gradually like learning more algorithm about how to sovle all kinds of problems.
