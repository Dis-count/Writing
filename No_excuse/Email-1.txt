Dear Professor Qi:

  Good afternoon!

  Sorry to interrupt you. Maybe it will take you several minutes to read this email.

  I am LiZikang, now a graduate student of Professor Liu at USTC.

  I want to apply to be your graduate student to continue my study career.

  Last year, I went to Nanjing to meet you under the guidance of Prof. Liu.

  You told me to master a programming language expertly, and I have been working on that.

  Besides that, I know that there are three courses I need to learn to pass the exam.

  Therefore, I have been improving my code and modeling capability, and I have already mastered the basic optimization methods, including deterministic and stochastic optimization.

  The attachment is about my resume.

  I notice that the application is coming. So there are two questions I want to ask you.

  The first one is about the proposal, I'm wondering if you can give me a proposal if you have an appropriate topic or project.

  The second one is about the English scores. Last year, I took the TOEFL examination but only got 79. I know the score is too low and since then I have been practicing to improve my English ability. However, due to the unexpected influence of COVID-19, I don't get the opportunity to take the English test because most of the tests have been cancelled. The latest test date I registered is 14th, Nov. I'm not sure if that is too late.

  I'm looking forward to your reply.

  Sincerely,

  LiZikang.
