Dear Professor Qi:

  Good afternoon!

  Sorry to interrupt you. Maybe it will take you several minutes to read this email.

  I am LiZikang, now a graduate student of Professor Liu at USTC.

  I want to apply to be your graduate student to continue my study career.

  Last year, I went to Nanjing to meet you under the guidance of Prof. Liu.

  You told me to master a programming language expertly, and I have been working on that.

  Besides that, I know that there are three courses I need to learn to pass the exam.

  Therefore, I have been improving my code and modeling capability, and I have already mastered the basic optimization methods, including deterministic and stochastic optimization.

  The attachment is about my resume.

  I notice that the application is coming. So there are two questions I want to ask you.

  The first one is about the proposal, I'm wondering if you can give me a proposal if you have an appropriate topic or project.

  The second one is about the English scores. Last year, I took the TOEFL examination but only got 79. I know the score is too low and since then I have been practicing to improve my English ability. However, due to the unexpected influence of COVID-19, I don't get the opportunity to take the English test because most of the tests have been cancelled. The latest test date I registered is 14th, Nov. I'm not sure if that is too late.

  I'm looking forward to your reply.

  Sincerely,

  LiZikang.



1.
电脑远程控制软件，之前用宣师兄推荐的 TeamViewer，大家也可以试试别的，找一个顺手的。
主要是可以把程序挂在学校的电脑上运行。

2.
登录图书馆的官网 http://lib.ustc.edu.cn/， 下面公告里有校外访问电子数据库资源指南（着重看第二第六条），可以通过学校统一身份认证账号访问学校资源。

3.
使用坚果云同步需要用到的科研资料，建议大家日常就使用一个同步软件整理科研要用的文件。

4.
家里比较吵的话，可以找图书馆和公共学习区域去学习。（这条是刘老师的建议）

5.
制定好每天的计划，挤时间尽可能完成每天安排的任务就可以了。
=====================
还需要 总结团队中存在的问题。
