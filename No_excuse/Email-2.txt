Dear Prof. Qi,

  Good morning!

  First of all, I am sorry that I have not contacted you for such a long time.

  Last time, I told you I would have an exam on 14/11/2020, but it was cancelled. Thus I had to change my schedule and take an exam in Chongqing on 29/11/2020.

  But that time I did not do well maybe because of the unexpectedly long journey and huge nervousness. I felt tired and had difficulty in concentrating on the examination.

  Then I took another exam last Sunday when you asked about my status.

  Although the result will not be as good as I should have, it will probably satisfy the minimum requirement you asked for.

  During those days, I felt so nervous that I did not contact you in time.

  But anyway, I have to express my deep apology for my carelessness. Moreover, I highly appreciate that you would like to reserve a position for me.

  I will send you another email in a few days about a summary for the last few months, a plan for the next several months, and questions about the application.

  Once the score of TOEFL is available, I will apply for the postgraduate program as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Zikang Li
