# About your work.

To tell the truth, some work is pointless. Thus, you should reflect your behavior and
be strict with yourself rather than complaining about others.

Do your best, except the worst. In fact, it is not the first time you feel so
frustrated. Last time is when you took the English test, maybe you paied a lot of
effort but did not obtain the corresponding result. You must feel disappointed but
what counts is how you solve this problem, why this thing will happen.

For the first thing, because you strived for a wrong direction, your effort cannot be
converted to the scores. Then find the right method is what you need to do rather than
feeling regretful. Do the following scheduling is the most advisable decision.

For the second, the main problem is that you excepted this work too much while others
do not care about it at all. From the bottom of my heart, I want to do my best. However,
the reality will eliminate/discourage/demotivate your enthusiasm. How to solve it?
I did not have the answer, just to get with /fit in with the work or leave it alone?
