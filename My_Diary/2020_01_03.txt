I'm trying to untangle the complex affairs of my minds.

That is from Dec.Fifth.2019. You didn't adjust your conditions well. You lost your mind. 

After Dec.Seventh.2019 TOEFL test, you can relax yourself for seven days.

Dec.14. YOU finished a beamer in one day. That's great.

Dec.21. you think about the inverse problem and attend the annual summary.

Dec.28. - Jan.3.  You wasted the whole week totally. You didnot want to do anything. You feel so frustrated and disappointed during this time.
BUT you cannot escape this reality. Maybe you were great at that time, however, right now you are not supreme anymore. 
Remember the pain, and being better again. Make yourself great again, I trust yourself.

You always think about the past, which is proved to be useless. So you should learn to forget it and look forwards. 

So what you need to do right now is improving yourself and waiting another time. Because you have the more important things, learning English 
and publishing a paper. After you have finished that, you can say you have the qualification right now. In other words, you missed the right timing 
and you can't match her right now because you didnot finish the English test and any papers. You have to accept that. 

**********************************************************************************
Think about why you are not too nervous and frustrated after having a quarrel with her at Jul.30. Because at that time you didnot realize 
your problem, you sympathized yourself, wanted to protect yourself. And you went to ShenZhen to learn English and relax yourself, you are 
occupied with chores, such as cooking, taking care of the kid. You didnot want to be disturbed and be afraid of punishment as you had made 
a mistake.
And August passed quickly, you finished the taxation paper at September. 
AND you apply for the TOEFL examination at October, you began to prepare for that, watched the videos, and listened almost everyday to 
improve your listening ability.
AND you got a new task about the inverse problem in November. You didnot get any obvious progress, so I think that is one of the reasons why you feel so disappointed.
Dec.7. You finished your test. But two days before the exam, you always thought about this distracting thing, which affected your status indeed.
After that, you are constantly in that bad mood. YOU feel disappointed at the terrible scores and you do not get any paper right now.

It's none of your business.
别管别人，跟我有毛线关系。
