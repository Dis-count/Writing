I'm trying to untangle the complex affairs of my minds.

That is from Dec.Fifth.2019. You didn't adjust your conditions well. You lost your mind. 

After Dec.Seventh.2019 TOEFL test, you can relax yourself for seven days.

Dec.14. YOU finished a beamer in one day. That's great.

Dec.21. you think about the inverse problem and attend the annual summary.

Dec.28. - Jan.3.  You wasted the whole week totally. You didnot want to do anything. You feel so frustrated and disappointed during this time.
BUT you cannot escape this reality. Maybe you were great at that time, however, right now you are not supreme anymore. 
Remember the pain, and being better again. Make yourself great again, I trust yourself.

You always think about the past, which is proved to be useless. So you should learn to forget it and look forwards. 

So what you need to do right now is improving yourself and waiting another time. Because you have the more important things, learning English 
and publishing a paper. After you have finished that, you can say you have the qualification right now. In other words, you missed the right timing 
and you can't match her right now because you didnot finish the English test and any papers. You have to accept that.
