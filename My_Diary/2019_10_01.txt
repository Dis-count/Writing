From right now, I want to write something to record what happened everyday, to remind me of what I should do to obtain my goal.

Today is the National Day, and also the 70th birthday of China. I got up at 9am, and arrived at the office in time to watch the Military Parade. After that, I didn't fall asleep at noon because of the annoying noise made by my roommate. And at about 3.30, I went for a run about four circles on the playground, then I first played basketball for more than two hours. I felt so tired that I just wanted to stay in my bed and fell asleep at about 9.30pm.
