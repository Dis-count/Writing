As far as I'm concerned, I prefer the latter one, students should volunteer to work in the university's city to improve some aspects of life, which will benefit the students to some extent.

For the first require, it must be admitted that students can be provided multiple thinking ways and learn a lot from different courses which has no direct connection to their major. However, during the precious one month, trying to practice in other activities rather than just still studying at school will provide the students more learning opportunities.

When students volunteer to help local primary school children with their homework, they can recall what they learned at school before which can also provide them a new comprehension of that knowledge from a different way. Besides that, as the students of the local school, they also need to get in touch with the local people, make their own contribution and adapt to the society earlier which will make a great difference to their future life.

Last but not least, the students taking the volunteer activity can touch different people will have a advanced consideration of their future career. And it is this activity which provide the precious opportunity for the students to challenge themselves. When they graduate, they must be grateful to choose this thing rather than to take the irrelevent courses.

All in all, I totally recommend the students as a volunteer to work to improve the life of the city.
