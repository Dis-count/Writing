The reading passage and the listening are talking about what the buildings of Chaco Canyon  were used for. The reading shows three competing theories about it. While, the professor claims that the arguments uesd to support the reading is not convincing.

The first theory that the article shows holds that the structures were purely residential. On the contrary, the professor challenges this theory by mentioning that there should be fireplaces in the buildings when the people have the daily cook. In fact, few fireplaces are found in this place.

The second theory the author shows contends that the structure were used to store food supplies. However, the lecturer also refute this theory by saying that there should be big container for containing maize and there wasn't spilled maize on the floor.

The third theory proposes that the houses were used as ceremonial centers. Nevertheless, the professor raise rational doubt by demonstrating that a lot of broken pots found in this place which should be considered as trash heap at that time. So the houses weren't used as ceremonial centers.

The author and the professor have contradictory opinions about what the Chaco houses were used for. According to the author, they were places for living, storing food and holding ceremonies, yet the professor argues that none of these theories of purposes was convincing.

The passage indicates Chaco houses are very much like the large “apartment buildings” in Tao, Mexico, so they must be made for residential purpose. However, the professor points out that there are not enough fireplaces found inside the Chaco houses. Rooms which could live hundreds of families only contain fireplaces for about ten families, and this indicates that the primary function of the houses was not residential.

Another predicted purpose of the Chaco houses was that they were built for storing food supplies due to their large sizes. On the contrary, the professor contends that not enough traces of either maize or big containers were found in the great houses. If they were really places of food storage, there would have been more spilled maize or the remains of their containers to be found.

Finally, the author states that the Chaco houses were places in which people hold ceremonies, for many broken pots were left in a mound near the houses, and the author believes that the pots were used in ceremonies and then discarded. Nevertheless, the professor mentions that beside the broken pots, many construction materials like sands, stones and even construction tools were found in the same mound. So it was possible that the pots were just regular trash which have nothing to do with ceremony at all.
