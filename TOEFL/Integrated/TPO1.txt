The reading passage and the lecture are talking about whether working a four-day week should be taken. The reading holds that a four-day workweek will benefit not only the companies and the employees. While, the professor claims that the arguments used to support the reading are not convincing.

To begin with, the reading passage holds that the shorten woekweek will increase company profits. However, the listening argues that hiring more staff results in the more healthy insurance costs and the company has to provide more space to hold the increasing number of employees. In fact, the company will not obtain profits from this change.

Moreover, the article says that this policy will reduce unemployment rates. But the professor argues that the company can ask these four-day workweek to work overtime, which absolutely does harm to the emplyees.

Finally, the reading passage said that the option will be better for individual employees. However, the professor argues that the option will affect the employees' job ability. Even worse, when the economy goes downtown, the four-day workweek emplyees will be the first ones lose their job.

*******************************************

The passage and the lecture are mainly about how four-day workweek will affect employees, companies and the society. The author believes that the new way of working offers many benefits; however, the professor argues that it is harmful.

According to the passage, a four-day work week makes employees more rested so that they make fewer mistakes, and companies also spend less money on paying salaries. Nevertheless, the professor points out that companies will actually spend more money. Although the salaries of employees cost less money, companies still have to pay for their health benefits, office space, and computers. Since there will be more employees, the cost will go up instead of going down.

The author suggests that the new option will benefit the country as a whole, for it can create new jobs and the unemployment rates will be reduced. On the other hand, the professor claims that companies might not hire new employees, and instead, they might require employees to work overtime and even expect them to do five daysâ€™ work within four days. This way, unemployment cannot be reduced and jobs will become more difficult to handle.

The passage indicates that the quality of life will be improved if people work four days a week, because they can have more leisure time to do a lot of different activities. On the contrary, the professor argues that life will become worse but not better, for bosses tend to hire and promote those who show up five days a week and employees working four days a week will be the first to lose jobs and they are less likely to be promoted. Without stability and promising future, life cannot be better.
