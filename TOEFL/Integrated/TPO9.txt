hydrogen can't solve the problem

1. can't easily obtain  need pure liquid water, the liquid need very cold temperature
need other costs to restore

2. even obtain h2 still can't solve the problem-- decrease the pollution, during the process require more coal.

3. cost saving
  the engine need a special metal, which is rare and expensive/ the efforts to replace the metal are unseccessful.
