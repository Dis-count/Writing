The reading passage and the listening are talking about the controversy of whether a painting was painted by Rembrandt or not. The reading holds that the style of painting doesn't fit to Rembrandt. While, the listening claims that the arguments  used to support the reading is not convicing, which means that the painting was indeed painted by Rembrandt.

Firstly, the reading holds that the the women in the portrait is dressed inconsistently. Rembrandt's painting would not have such an inconsistency. However, the listening argues that by the X-ray technique the painting was painted again by someone after the portrait was painted several hundreds years. Someone repainted the women to increase the value of this portrait.

Secondly, the passage argues that the light and shadow in this painting don't fit together while Rembrandt was a master of these elements so he would not make this mistake. On the contrary, the professor points out that after removed the painting the original painting showed that the face would reflect the light, which accord with the feat of Rembrandt.

Thirdly, the author contends that the painting was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood, which contradicts the habit of Rembrandt. On the other hand, the lecture mentions that when Rembrandt painted this portrait, he used several pieces of wood to make the painting more grant and valued. And this wood was also used for another his painting which also can explain why it was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood.

The passage and the lecture are mainly about whether a painting was painted by Rembrandt or not. While the author believes it cannot be a work by Rembrandt, the professor holds an opposite view.

First, the author doubts the authenticity of the painting due to its inconsistency in details—the woman in the luxurious coat was actually wearing a cap of a servant. However, the professor points out that with the help the X-rays, experts found that the luxurious collar was painted over the top of the original panting. That is because someone might try to make the painting more expensive by having it look like a portrait of an aristocratic/wealthy lady.

Second, the passage indicates that the light and shadow were mistaken in the painting, and Rembrandt should not have made such mistakes. On the contrary, the professor claims that light and shadow would have been correct and precise without the collar fur painted afterwards. Since the original color of the coat was light, the woman’s face is not meant to be partially in shadow.

Finally, the author states that since no other paintings of Rembrandt were on panels made of several pieces of wood, the painting on such a panel cannot be his work. Nevertheless, the professor argues that the painting on one of the pieces of wood was drawn by Rembrandt, while several other pieces were added by others. Also, the original piece of wood was proved to be from the same tree as another painting of Rembrandt’s.
