-----------------------------

To begin with, the author claims that 阅读第一论点.., because 原文简单原因的改写. Nevertheless, the lecture makes the point that 听力第一论点. According to the listening passage, 听力第一分论点解释/例子.
This perspective differs from what is maintained in the article.

Moreover, the reading passage states that 阅读第二论点 (没有原因，就用 whereas the speaker views this issue in a comletely different angle). However, the speaker views this issue in a comletely different angle. In accordance with the speaker, 听力第二分论点 + 听力第二分论点的具体解释 or 具体例子.
This directly contradicts what the reading passage indicates.

Finally, the article insists that 阅读第三论点+ 解释. On the contrary, the speaker challenges the article's contention by saying that 听力第三论点。
To convince the audience, the speaker elaborates his standpoint with the evidence/fact/finding/experiment that 听力第三分论点的具体解释 or 具体例子.
This is where the speaker disagrees with the article.

To sum up, the lecturer illustrates his disagreement with the theory/ general idea of the article by demonstrating the evidence mentioned above.
