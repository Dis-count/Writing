The reading passage and the listening are talking about whether online encyclopedias have more advantages than traditional ones or not. The author believes that online encyclopedias have more problems than traditional encyclopedias. While, the professor claims that the arguments used to support the conclusion in the reading are not convincing.

To begin with, the reading passage holds that online encyclopedias lack acedemic credentials while traditional encyclopedias are written by the trained professionals. However, the professor argues that traditional encyclopedias almost have more errors and these errors will remian for decades while the errors in the online ones can be revised soon.

Moreover, the article says that some users will fabricate or delete the information in the encyclopedias. Rather than what the passage demonstrates, the security of online encyclopedias are noticed by people and they have made special format of these contents. Once the information is changed deliberately by someone, the special monitors
will notice that and prohibit these behaviors.

Finally, the author mentioned that online encyclopedias focus too frequently, is too trivial while traditional ones can provide what is important. But the lecturer emphasize that traditional encyclopedias have limited space so they just show the most important things. On the contrary, online encyclopedias have infinite space to satisfy the demand of users who can provide a variety of view on these topics. That is the merit of online encyclopedias which traditional ones don't have.
