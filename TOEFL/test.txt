1. 社会现象--  （句法知识  灵活使用 避免审美疲劳 Unique）
When we browse the education reports of the major media, especially in the graduation period,
an employment rate ranking may arise that is refered to as talent market competition. Career plan among topics
of modern education is a major concern of society. Taking into account the need of employment, some people propose that

Nevertheless, I reject this notion and instead believe that schools should cultivate students a wide range of subjects.
