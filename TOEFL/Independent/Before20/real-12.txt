Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents today find it harder to influence their children for children are now influenced by many things outside home.

With the gradually increase of living stansard of families in China, people are spending more time and energies on discussing about the education issues, one of which is related to the children. There is a growing body of opnion that parents find it harder to influence their children today. To be honest, I totally agree with this statement, for as a children many years ago, I can understand this situation.

Admittedly, parents are the first group to influence their children when they are at a very young age and they have the dominant power about the influence. From the time a babies was born to when they growed up at ten years old, they were always under the protection or in other words, influence of their parents. The parents made their great efforts to teach them basic skills to let them adapt to the society, provide them all the conveniences to let them grow up healthily, protect them from the terrible things by letting them form good habits. To some degree, parents hold the greatest responsibility for the growth of their children. Therefore, there is no doubt that parents have the great influence on the children.

However, the context written above often happen in the last decades, at that time, parents have a lot of time to take care of their children. Nowadays, as life rhythm accelerates, people spend less and less time on their education of their children, let alone the influence. Right now, you can see that the education trade grows up to a very tremendous industry, which shows not only people thinks highly of the education more than before, but also people don't have the time to care about their children and have to send their children to these organizations. In this background, parents will have very little influence on their childeren over time.

Furthermore, besides the less time spended by parents on the their children, the smart devices are going to have big affect on children.
As we all know, there is a bunch of  leading-edge devices coming out, including the smart phone, pad, laptop, which indeed provide great conveniences for people. However, it also brought lots of problems here, one of which is that children don't have the corresponding self-control to combat this advanced devices. They can't control themselves but spend most of time on them, gradully they are influenced by the contents on the devices easily. In this way, we can see so many news talks about children use their parents phones to spend money on useless things, which strongly shows that they are influenced easily by the smart devices rather than their parents.
