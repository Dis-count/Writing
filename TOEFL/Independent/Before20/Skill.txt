要躲避模板查重系统，切忌盲目去背诵固定语言模板，失去思考能力;

从这个立场来看，今天老师提供的三种都可以有效规避此类问题，希望对大家的备考有所启发。都是一些压箱底的地道句式：

01题目：

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

An effective leader should try to make others feel that they are part of the decision-making process.

学员写作成绩30分举例

As the society expanded into more complicated forms, people started to contemplate on many aspects of life. Leadership is one of the ideas that human beings endeavored to explicate for centuries. Traditionally, people defined the effective leadership as being the dominating voice and steering the majority of the group towards positive result. Conversely, I deem that a leader should be capable of handling affairs with discretion and making other groups members to feel involved during the decision-making process.

学员写作成绩29分举例

Have you ever finished five tests one school day? Can you ever imagine that you are accused by your teacher because of your low academic performance? Have you ever stayed up late in order to prepare a lesson for your students? Some people assert that school should increase teacher’s salaries based on the students’ performance. I deem that teachers’ wages should not be determined by students’ performance.

03题目

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

It is easier for people today to keep healthy than in the past.

学员写作成绩29分举例

I have always been secretly glad that I’m born in such an age and shuddered in fear to imagine what would have become of me if I was born in the past. One thing that I am especially thankful for is the healthy condition today. I believe that it is easier to people to be healthy than it is in the past as people have better access of medical treatments and also can spare enough attention for themselves to exercise.

鉴于这位同学实在太优秀，给大家再附一份开头的方式：

04题目

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

Having jobs with low paying salary and being hit secure is better than jobs with high salary but being easy to lose.

学员写作成绩29分举例2

It is the human’s natural instinct to avoid taking risks, and this is the rule that I have been following for most of my life. I believe that it is better to take a stable job despite having less income than to take a high-risk job with a high pay as it offers better life quality, and a healthier mental state.

以上是老师给出的三种开头方式：背景引入、连续发问及情景共通法，大家可以根据不同话题，结合自己的实际分情况去使用。
