The reading and lecture are talking about whether the wood companies in the United States would advertise the ecocertified products or not. The reading passage holds that it is unlikely the wood companies would do that, however, the listening claims that the arguments used to  support the reading are not convincing, which means the wood companies would advertise the ecocertified products.

Firstly, the reading holds that American consumers would not care about these new advertisements. On the contrary, the lecture argues that the consumer would notice the difference of these advertisement, and these ads would arouse the consumer to pay more attention to the environment.

Secondly, the article says that ecocertified wood will be more expensive than uncertified wood so that the consumers will tend to choose the products with lower price. However, the processor claims that a surver shows that the comsumers will not consider the slight difference of the price too much, as long as the products is environment-friendly.

Thirdly, the author holds that it is unnecessary that the American conpanies keep up with the development of the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the listening argues that it is crucial for the American companies to trade the products abroad. Because if they do not do that, the other companies will take up the American market and have a bigger influence around the whole world, which will cause enormous harm to not only the consumers but the American companies.

The passage and the lecture have contradictory opinions about whether American wood companies should pursue eco-certification or not. According to the passage, it makes no sense for American companies to have their products eco-certified; however, the professor claims that getting such certifications is not only beneficial but also necessary.

The author does not believe that American consumers will be motivated by the eco-certification label, for they are already tired of advertisements exaggerating the merits of mediocre products. On the other hand, the professor argues that American consumers do not treat all advertising the same and they usually place much trust in claims made by independent organizations with a good reputation of trustworthiness, which is why wood products with eco-certification will be welcomed.

The passage indicates that the extra costs caused by pursuing eco-certification will make the price less competent and consumers will choose the cheaper products. Nevertheless, the professor points out that consumers are affected by money only when the price of a product is much higher or lower, say, more than five percent, than which of the competing one. Since eco-certification will not lead to that much difference, American consumers would choose on factors other than price.

The author suggests that American wood companies mostly sell their products to domestic consumers who are satisfied with what they get, so there is no need to keep up with the international developments. Yet the professor mentions that if American companies are slow having their products certified, they would lose their market share, because foreign companies will have an advantage by providing products that they cannot offer.
