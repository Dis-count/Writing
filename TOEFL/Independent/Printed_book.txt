Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students twenty years from now will no longer use printed books.

With the presence of new technology, there is a bunch of leading-edge devices coming out. Among these advanced products, ipad and computers serves as a important role in people's life. Consequently, some people conclude that after twenty years, the students will not use the printed books. However, from my perspective, though these products can provide the convenience for the students, they will also distract them from studying in the classes. So, I don't agree with the statement.

With the development of technology, the price of electronic products is gradually decreasing year by year, more and more families can reach these advanced products. Therefore, we can predicted that after twenty years more parents will provide their children an ipad or the similar products to encourage them to study. There is no doubt that these tools will increase the productivity.

写到这 突然发现好像有点跑题，重点应该放在 20 年 而不是单纯的 纸质书和电子书的特点

Since many students in developing countries are unlikely to afford e-books, printed ones will continue playing an important part in the near future. One of the primary advantages of using paper books is the low cost and even students in developed countries like the United States today are still using them almost everyday. It is hard to believe that all the countries in the world will be wealthy enough to afford every student at school electronic books. In comparison with e-books, printed books are much more cost-effective choices and will still be popular at school in most countries even 20 years from now.


Another reason which keeps paper popular is the convenience they offer, and it is clear that e-books might never have those attributes. Paper books are so easy to take and to read anywhere: you never worry about running out of battaries and the notes you take or the signs you mark will never disappear because of that. On the contrary, people usually need to take extra care when using e-books, for they could be easily broken. We often see that people pass their printed books to others by throwing them, yet they can never do the same to e-books. Printed books just have too many advantages that they cannot be easily replaced soon.


No matter how advanced and powerful e-books are, schools should always consider carefully whether to use them since not all students can benefit from their merits. High school and university students may find electronic books powerful tools helping them study, yet primary school students, lacking self-control, are very likely to treat them like toys. The functions that printed books do not have, such as connection to the Internet and video playing, would probably distract them instead of improving their efficiency. It is for sure that both parents and teachers would not like to see that both now and in the future.


Technology indeed changes us and the world we live in, but it does not easily make things disappear. Printed books, enjoying so many advantages that e-books never possess, will continue to be used in the near future or even forever.

本文使用了三个段落来否定 会被取代的论调：

1. 使用了 原因分析 是实体书的低成本 以及 假设分析  注意 使用‘比较’。

2. 方便： 双向比较（对比明显） 一方面，实体方便 另一方面 电子却需要特殊照顾。

3. 对于学生 弊大于利  注意分群体 小孩子还没有足够的辨识度 更多的选择是当作玩具而不是利用来更好的学习。 这里用到了举例。
