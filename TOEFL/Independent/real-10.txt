Learning math, language, science and history is the primary goal for most students
to attend schools and it is indeed valuable and important. Math cultivates our logical thinking; science explain how the world and the universe function; language
allows us to communicate; history teaches us wisdom and strategies. The knowledge and information we gain from such education enables us to make our own judgements and decisions wisely and independently. Without knowing the facts and principles from these courses, the world we live in and even ourselves will appear to be so unpredictable.

Although the subjects I mentioned in the last paragraph teach students a lot, they are still not enough and need to be complemented by other education such as are and music classes. Learning art and music helps people relaxed, which is quite necessary in such a competitive and stressful society. Many students at school take having such classes as an opportunity to find relief from the heavy schoolwork, and they will also listen to music and go exhibitions to reduce stress from jobs.

Besides the relief   --> conversation
