1. In response to the problem, some people may argue that___ But is it? Close analysis does not bear out the argument.
2. To choose A or choose B is something of a dilemma to the public because they sometimes are confused by the seemingly good qualities of B, and neglect the genuinely good aspects of A.
3. There is no denying the fact that whether to choose A or B is better is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time (because it affects everybody in his or her daily lives).
Although it seems that sometimes we cannot tell which one outweighs the other between A and B, they deserve some close examination.
There are no less than three advantages in A as rendered below:

这里积累一些素材
Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the "10,000-Hour Rule", claiming that the key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours.

He examines why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in the first few months of the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, how the Beatles became one of the most successful musical acts in human history.

主体段的结构
第一句  可以是直接陈述 论点/或者是  since ..., 论据这样的论点.
第二句, 可以是 假设分析,分三小句, 如果没有,会怎么样, 更不用说别的..
第三句, in addition, 除此之外,还有这样的小优点.(前者是如果有的话怎么样, 或者是另一方面, 为什么没有,是什么造成的,这才是问题所在而不是文章所提到的那个原因.)
第四句,  可以是 no wonder
第五句, 总结.

Template:
1、 For B, people are often driven to believe that ……. (As a proverb says, “Everything has two
sides”.) Although B does have its seemingly profound advantages, at the mean time there lies
intrinsic harmful characteristics in it such as …… Some experts maintain that……. This
significant point, however, is often not noticed by public. And accordingly, is unconsciously
overlooked. What is more, if you notice the invisible benefits of CHOOSING A, you can
understand A more deeply.
2、 On the other hand, choosing B also has advantages to some extent.
However, it is also important to see that under certain circumstances B will ……(disadvantage)
或：Yet there are some people who cast serious doubts on B
3、 第四段：（针对我个人的情况又可以说出一套理由）But if all these factors are contemplated,
according to my personality and fondness, the advantages of A carry more weight than those
of B because A fits me better in two ways:
4、 Moreover, ________also provides adequate justification for my opinion. According to 100
studies carried out in 10 major cities throughout China,___________." No one can deny the
truth behind the number."
In addition, an equally essential factor which deserves people's attention is_______.
Admittedly, it may be true that ______.However, this alone does not provide sufficient
support to claim that______. Actually, it is too specific and weak to strengthen the point
that_________.


小句子中, 多用状语从句结构,多用关系词连接小分词.
******************************************
结尾段 结构
要从一个更高的角度进行统一, 一般是横向比较一个事物的两个方面, 所以第一句需要讲该事物的特点(生活中很重要,不然这个题没什么意义), 第二句要点题 尽管提到的那个很重要, 但是 更重要的原因是什么.

Template:
1、 Which one I prefer depends on my own experience, life style and emotional concerns. To be frank, I would like to choose A
2、 Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that CHOOSING AAA is a rather wise decision.
3、 There is little doubt that more and more people will come to realize that_______.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
总结一下, 如果是同意给出的观点, 那么就采用情景共通的方法: 抽象该问题的背景(我的简单经历),我的看法,简单原因.
如果是不同意的观点, 采用经典的背景引入方法: 背景(可以利用时间维度上的阐述,从古至今or traditionally 观点引入), Conversely, 我的观点.

Some useful expressions:

one of the ideas human endeavored to explicate

主体段： 1. 分论点 2. 分论据 3. 小总结


**************补充不同类型的题目 解题方法**************

二选一 ：题目无态度，ABB BAA  优点 或是 AAA（不好写） 不要分类讨论，因为没有相同介质。

三选一 ：A不好； B比A好，但也有不好； C比B好， 最好的。
算是一种但是对比不明显, 直接说 A 好,但没C好; B 好,但也有缺点; C 好,即使没有A,B, C也能好.

横向对比： 有态度，同时是唯一可以使用中立结构的。
